# Molecular_Solubility_Predictor

## Overview: 
Built a machine learning model to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of molecules â€” a critical property in the early stages of drug discovery. This project leverages regression algorithms to estimate how easily a compound can dissolve, aiding researchers in screening viable drug candidates with better pharmacokinetic properties.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack: 
Python â€“ Primary language for data handling and modeling

Pandas & NumPy â€“ For efficient data cleaning and feature manipulation

Scikit-learn â€“ Applied Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ For data visualization and result interpretation

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab â€“ For interactive experimentation and visualization

## ðŸ§© System Architecture 
1. Data Loading â†’ 2. Feature Engineering â†’ 3. Model Training â†’ 4. Evaluation & Visualization

Data Loading: Molecular descriptors and solubility labels are loaded into a structured DataFrame from a preprocessed dataset.

Feature Engineering: Checked for missing values, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and selected relevant features affecting solubility.

Model Training: Employed a train-test split strategy with two models: Linear Regression for baseline performance and Random Forest for non-linear learning.

Evaluation & Visualization: Measured accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score. Visualized predicted vs actual values and feature importance.
